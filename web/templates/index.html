<h2>RRA = Random Reddit Account</h2>
<p class="lead">
  The username is generated from animal names, adjectives and city names
  totalling around <strong>9,990,695</strong> possible different usernames.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately the maximum username length is 20 characters so sometimes we can't 
  use words from all 3 of those things (animal, adjective, city), in this case
  a random number is inserted somewhere into the word.
</p>
<p>
    Please note that the registration happens server-side, this essentially means that sometimes the app gets blocked from reddit for 5-10 minutes!
